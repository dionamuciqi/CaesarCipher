# Caesar Cipher Decryption

This Java program performs Caesar cipher decryption on a given ciphertext using a specified key. It reads the ciphertext from a file or directly from the code, applies the decryption, and outputs the result.


## Objectives

The primary objectives of this code are:

1. **Caesar Cipher Decryption:**
   - Implement a Caesar cipher decryption algorithm to decipher a given ciphertext.
   - Use a specified key (celesi) for the decryption process.

2. **Keyword-Based Decryption:**
   - Search for potential keywords in the ciphertext to aid in the decryption process.
   - The keywords used for decryption are "AND" and "IS."

3. **Output Decrypted Text:**
   - Print the decrypted text to the console.
